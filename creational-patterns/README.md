# Creational Patterns

## Intent
- A mechanism to create new objects or control the creation of new objects 

## Patterns
### Prototype
- Cloning / copy existing objects 
- Used when the creation of a new object is very expensive compared to the cloning of an existing object and modifications

### Singleton
- Used when we have to create only a single instance of a class 
- Restrict the creation of an object to the constructor

### Factory
- Used when all the objects creation and its business logic we need to keep in a single place
